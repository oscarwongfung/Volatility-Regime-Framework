# Volatility-Regime-Framework

Vol Regime Framework for Dynamic Equity Exposure

This project explores how equity market risk changes under different volatility environments. Using the VIX and realized volatility of the S&P 500, the analysis classifies market conditions into low, medium, and high volatility regimes. It then examines how equity returns and drawdowns behave across these regimes and evaluates a simple exposure-adjustment approach that increases equity exposure in low-volatility periods and reduces exposure during high-volatility periods. The results highlight the tendency of volatility to cluster and show that large drawdowns are more common during high-volatility regimes, suggesting that volatility-aware positioning can help manage risk without relying on return forecasts.
